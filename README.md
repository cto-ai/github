## Requirements ðŸ”‘

To run this or any other Op, install the [Ops Platform.](https://cto.ai/platform). Find more information about how to run and build Ops via the [Platform Documentation](https://cto.ai/docs/overview)

This Op also requires an access token to interact with Github.

* To create a Github access token:
  
  * Create an access token with the `repo` and `admin` scopes following the instructions here[here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).

  * Copy the access token and provide it when prompted.
  
  * Your remote `origin` must be set to a valid Github repo.

## Usage

Running `ops run github`, gives you a list of available commands to get you started. 

## Local Development

To develop and run ops locally:

  1. Clone the repo `git clone <git url>`
  2. `cd` into the directory and install dependancies with `npm install`
  3. Run the Op from your local source code with `ops run path/to/op`
